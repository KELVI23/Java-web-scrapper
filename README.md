# Java Web Scraper

This Java project is designed to extract data from web pages using the [HtmlUnit](https://htmlunit.sourceforge.io/) library, providing a foundation for web scraping tasks such as data mining, analysis, and automated testing.

## Features

- **Web Scraping**: Connects to specified URLs and retrieves HTML content.
- **Data Extraction**: Parses HTML to extract relevant information.
- **Headless Browser Simulation**: Utilizes HtmlUnit to simulate browser behavior, enabling interaction with dynamic content.

## Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure JDK 8 or higher is installed.
- **Maven**: For managing project dependencies and building the project.
- **HtmlUnit Library**: Included as a Maven dependency.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KELVI23/Java-web-scrapper.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Java-web-scrapper
   ```

3. **Build the Project with Maven**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the main class to start the web scraping process.
   - Monitor the console output or designated files for the extracted data.

## Configuration

- **Target URLs**: Modify the application settings to specify the URLs you wish to scrape.
- **Data Parsing Logic**: Adjust the parsing methods to extract the specific data fields required for your application.

## Notes

- **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure compliance with each website's `robots.txt` directives and terms of service before scraping.
- **Performance**: Be mindful of the load imposed on target servers; implement appropriate delays between requests if necessary.
- **Data Accuracy**: The quality of extracted data depends on the structure of the target web pages and may require adjustments to parsing logic.
